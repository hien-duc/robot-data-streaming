# VDA5050 Robot Data Streaming System - Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete VDA5050-compliant robot data streaming solution that simulates an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) or Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) streaming operational data using the MQTT protocol. The system was developed to address the specific requirement of streaming robot data in compliance with the VDA5050 standard.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **MQTT Communication Module**
   - Robust MQTT client implementation using paho-mqtt library
   - Configurable connection parameters (host, port, manufacturer, serial number)
   - Graceful error handling for connection failures
   - Automatic reconnection capabilities

2. **VDA5050 Message Generation**
   - Implementation of all three required VDA5050 message types:
     * Connection messages
     * State messages
     * Visualization messages
   - Compliance with VDA5050 v2.0.0 specification
   - Proper message formatting with header IDs and timestamps
   - Standardized topic structure: `/vda5050/{manufacturer}/{serialNumber}/{messageType}`

3. **Robot Simulation Engine**
   - Realistic robot behavior simulation
   - Dynamic position updates with path generation
   - Battery level simulation
   - Operational state changes (driving, operating mode)

4. **Multi-Robot Support**
   - Concurrent operation of multiple robot instances
   - Unique identifiers for each robot
   - Configurable publish frequencies per robot
   - Thread-based implementation for scalability

5. **Error Handling and Robustness**
   - Graceful handling of MQTT connection failures
   - Continued operation during broker disconnections
   - Clear error messages and logging
   - Proper shutdown procedures

6. **Comprehensive Documentation and Utilities**
   - Detailed setup guides for local MQTT broker
   - Batch files for simplified execution on Windows
   - Test scripts for verification
   - Message processing examples

   - Confirmed proper topic structure
   - Verified sequential header ID implementation

3. **Multi-Robot Support**
   - Successfully ran multiple robot instances concurrently
   - Verified unique identifiers for each robot
   - Confirmed separate topic hierarchies

4. **Local Broker Integration**
   - Tested with local Mosquitto broker installation
   - Verified message publishing and subscription
   - Confirmed compatibility with public brokers (test.mosquitto.org)

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
1. Install Mosquitto MQTT broker
2. Double-click `start_mosquitto.bat` to start the broker
3. Double-click `run_robot_streamer.bat` to start the robot streamer
4. Double-click `monitor_topics.bat` to monitor messages

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Run with default settings
python robot_streamer.py

# Customize parameters
python robot_streamer.py --host localhost --port 1883 --manufacturer KUKA --serial KR_1001 --frequency 5.0

# Run multiple robots
python multi_robot_demo.py
```

## System Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Mosquitto MQTT broker (for local testing)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system
- Internet connection (for public broker testing)

## VDA5050 Compliance

This implementation fully complies with the VDA5050 v2.0.0 standard:

- Proper topic hierarchy: `/vda5050/{manufacturer}/{serialNumber}/{messageType}`
- Correct message structure with required fields
- Sequential header ID management
- Standard timestamp format
- Appropriate message content for each message type

## Integration Capabilities

The system is ready for integration with fleet management systems that support VDA5050:
